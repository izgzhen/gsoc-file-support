Everything about living a decent life in Servo community :P


1. `r? @SomeOne`  in a comment and the reviewer gets changed
2. `./mach update-cargo -p uuid --precise 0.2.2` to resolve dependency problem
3. If there is duplicated code in `Constructor` of parent and child, don't nest `Constructor` but instead write another helper function
4. Write low-level raw bindings in a `-sys` crate
5. When someone `ping` you, a `pong` looks more professional than a `?`
6. Every time you have to `unwrap` something, ask yourself why
7. Change `FAIL` to `PASS` in test `.ini` to get more error info out
8. Test `.ini`s might contain out-dated specs
9. Try to note down points of discussion on IRC
10. With major changes to the script interface, go through the WPT tests again
