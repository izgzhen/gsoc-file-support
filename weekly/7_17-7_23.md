- [x] Correctness evaluation
    - [note](../notes/analysis.md)
    - Pending [Fix FileAPI's refcount implementation #12579](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12579)
- Fixing/Refactoring
    - [x] Land [Fix Blob type-string #12400](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12400)
- Performance (with benchmarking)
    - [x] Pending [Chunked ReadFile from file manager #12577](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12577)
- Track the `Origin` dependency [note](../notes/origin.md)
- Track `ArrayBuffer` dependency [note](../notes/typed_array.md)

## TODOs before final evaluation

Priority of completion before final: [H] - High, [M] - Medium, [L] - Low.

+ Performance tuning
    + [M] Reduce overhead by caching etc
    + [M] Stress-proof: Don't break things just because we (try to) upload a 1GB file
+ Correctness evaluation
    + [H] Abstract out current implementation and propose some basic invariants/properties to check
    + [H] Also, due to the complexity of current design, a clear description of relationship with spec would be good to handle the future spec changes
+ Testing
    + [H] Make a checklist of existing tests and try to solve them
    + [H] Add more tests, esp. covering some intricate points of spec
+ Final evaluation
    + [M] Going through the in-tree doc and make sure that the it is complete & consistent
    + [L] Produce a list of related TODOs for future reference
+ (Nice-to-have-but-not-critical) Functional requirements
    + [L] ArrayBuffer/ArrayBufferView support
    + [L] Blob URL fragment identifier implementation
    + [L] `URL.createFor` implementation



## Checklist of deliverables in original proposal
### Complete File and Blob APIs
1. `Blob` construction from in-memory
    - [x] `Blob`
    - [ ] `ArrayBuffer`, `ArrayBufferView` (Blocked on external)
2. `File` construction from in-memory
    - [x] `DOMString` or `Blob` accompanied with file name.
    - [ ] `ArrayBuffer`, `ArrayBufferView` (Blocked on external)
3. Support for `Blob` underlying storage as file on disk
    * [x] File descriptor management (`net/filemanager_thread.rs`)
    * [x] Buffer management (`net/filemanager_thread.rs`, `script/dom/blob.rs`)
    * [x] readability-state management (i.e. `blob.close` method, `script/dom/blob.rs`)
4. [x] Add missing attributes of `File` such as `lastModified` and `type` (`type` is delegated to `Blob`)
5. [x] Implement closing of `Blob` considering the Data URL.
6. Implement missing parts in `FileReader`
    - [ ] `readAsArrayBuffer` (Blocked on external)
    - [x] `result` attribute

#### Form control and submission
1. [x] Implement the dialog UI which lets user to select files based on FFI binding to `nativefiledialog` or other UI library like `kiss-ui`.
    * [x] Handler to the `click` event on file input element
    * [x] Route the path information about selected files to `File` object constructors
2. [x] Implement the missing parts handling the `<input>` element whose `type` is `file`
3. [ ] Implement the sending mechanism of a file input over network (not verified yet, but as I previously checked the infra should be relatively complete)

#### Blob URLs creation, manipulation and response
1. [x] URL scheme and serialization
2. [x] Origin check
3. [x] Dereferencing model
4. [x] Programmatic APIs for creation and revoking of Blob URL
