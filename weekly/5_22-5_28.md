# Weekly note 5/22 - 5/28

## Mini-goals this week

- [ ] Land #11221 and #11225, and examine the integrated part before proceeds
- [ ] Do some experimental hack on `ArrayBuffer` and `sequence`
- [ ] Start working on Blob URL scheme
- Keep improving the `libnfd` package
    - [ ] CMake

## Misc
* @nox landed [the PR](https://github.com/servo/rust-mozjs/pull/264) fixing WebIDL `sequence<T>` conversion in rust-mozjs a few days ago, which eliminated some failed Blob/File constructor cases
