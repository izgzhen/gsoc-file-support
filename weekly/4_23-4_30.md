## Pitfalls
Regarding disk-I/O, be sure to scrutinize the File spec especially regarding on-disk Files and snapshot state before proceeding, since it might get fiddly with respect to file changes in the underlying storage (Blobs, for example, seem to reflect changes to the underlying storage; even slices -- so if you slice a blob and then cut the file to before the slice starts, the sliced blob becomes empty)
