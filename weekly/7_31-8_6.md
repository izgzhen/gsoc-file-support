# Weekly note 7/31 - 8/6

## Mini-goals this week
+ [x] Land [Add form submission for file type input and related fixings #12536](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12536)
+ [x] Pending [Add XHR support for FormData and related fixes](#12780)
+ [x] Solve [Utilise cancel listener for reading content from file manager](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/12589)
+ [x] Land [Fix FileAPI's refcount implementation #12579](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12579)
- Testing
    - [x] Land [Update FileAPI WPT idlharness #12662](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12662) by [Add cancellability to file manager load and related refactoring #12684](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12684)
- [x] Land [Add FileReaderSync skeleton #12663](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12663)
- Track the `Origin` dependency [note](../notes/origin.md)
- Track `ArrayBuffer` dependency [note](../notes/typed_array.md)
    - [Implement FileReader::readAsArrayBuffer #12555](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/12555) This is actually easier -- since we can directly grab an object and manually get the bytes. But for `blob` constructor, we need to generate the bindings to differentiate the typed array objects
