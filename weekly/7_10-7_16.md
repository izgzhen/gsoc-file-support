# Weekly note 7/10 - 7/16

## Delivered this week

- Fixes
    - [x] **Revocation**: Landed [Add FileID validity setting/checking logic to Blob URL implementation #12378](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12378). This is not a perfect shot as I and Manish discussed on IRC, but we decide to investigate later as a whole once we confirmed that no functional requirements are missing.
- Blob URL
    - [x] Implement missing parts of `blob.Close()` (also in #12378)
    - [x] Landed [Put Blob URL online #12440](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12440)
- [x] Review the spec
- Fixing/Refactoring
    - [x] Pending [Fix Blob type-string #12400](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12400)
    - [x] Landed [Refactor FileAPI implementation #12406](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12406)
- Performance (proposed, partially implemented in #12406)
    - Some bench would be nice
    - Chunked reading from fm to script
    - Caching meta-info (e.g. size) etc. of file to avoid unnecessary reading, this might again involve the snapshot state problem, we should handle carefully here.
    - Take advantage of the slice pos in reading to reduce unnecessary traffic
- Track the `Origin` dependency
    - Once [unguessable pipeline id](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/10808) is landed, [a central, trustable repository of Origins](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/11722) should not be hard to implement.
- Track `ArrayBuffer` dependency [note](../notes/typed_array.md)
