# Weekly note 7/10 - 7/16

## Mini-goals this week

- Fixes
    - [ ] **Revocation**: The problem is that, for `DecRef` given an ID, the entry has to deal with two kinds of request sources  -- either the msg directly asking for it, or indirect recursive call caused by slicing. For the former case, we should mark the entry as non-externally-visible when revoked, which causes following content requests on this to fail properly; while at the same time, it continues to be internally visible, until the day of 0 ref count.
- Blob URL
    - [ ] handle `blob.Close()`
    - [ ] Put Blob URL online, and consider adding more WPT tests.
- [ ] Review the spec and check if any functional requirement is missing
- Performance (proposed)
    - [ ] Some bench would be nice
    - [ ] Chucked reading from fm to script
    - [ ] Caching meta-info (e.g. size) etc. of file to avoid unnecessary reading, this might again touch the snapshot state, we should handle careful here.
    - [ ] Take advantage of the slice pos in reading to reduce useless traffic
- Track the `Origin` dependency
    - Once [unguessable pipeline id](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/10808) is landed, [a central, trustable repository of Origins](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/11722) should not be hard to implement.
- Track `ArrayBuffer` dependency
