    - [x] [PR #11534 Add Blob URL store](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/11534) (merged)

## Discussion over a more unified implementation

We discussed about where Blob URL store should reside and the related changes in creating a more unified model ([log](http://logs.glob.uno/?c=mozilla%23servo&s=4+Jun+2016&e=5+Jun+2016))

### Main points

+ Better to store the blob data *within* the net threads, in form of a Blob URL store. For two reasons:
    * If we navigate to a newly created Blob URL, the store itself should not be destroyed by document unload
    * In this way the resource loading in net won't have to send message to script process to get the data it needs
+ Three sources of `Blob`:
    * `new Blob(array)`: construct the `Blob` object by making a `Arc` to newly allocated `DataSlice` and leave it alive under script process for now
    * File uploads, XHR etc. (from net process): Let net thread do the I/O and send back a registered uuid, which is used to construct the `Blob`
    * `Blob.slice(otherblob)`
+ Call `URL.createObjectURL` on a DataSlice blob will move the underlying data to the resource process, and replace inner implementation with registered uuid
+ In the net process's Blob store, the uuid can be mapped to three kinds of representation:
    + a "sliced" uuid (like an indirect pointer)
    + a concrete, in-memory representation 
    + a file path

### Unresolved
+ `origin::Origin` can't be used inside net threads now

### Note
+ See how Firefox does these
+ Be careful about blob deletion
