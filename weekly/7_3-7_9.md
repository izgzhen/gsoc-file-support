# Weekly note 7/3 - 7/9

## Mini-goals this week

- Give `Blob` backends an upgrade!
    - [ ] Land [Integration and improvements of File API backends #11875](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/11875)
        - refcounting
        - more origin checking
        - handle slices better
        - misc fixes
- Fixes & Improvements
    - [ ] File manage should spawn one thread per request or keep a pool of worker threads to prevent blocking
    - Keep reviewing & testing ...
- Track the `Origin` dependency
    - Once [unguessable pipeline id](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/10808) is landed, [a central, trustable repository of Origins](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/11722) should not be hard to implement.
- Track `ArrayBuffer` dependency
